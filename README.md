# Knights and Knaves Puzzle Solver

Welcome to the Knights and Knaves Puzzle Solver project! This project aims to represent the puzzles from Raymond Smullyan's 1978 book "What is the name of this book?" using propositional logic, allowing an AI running a model-checking algorithm to solve the puzzles for us.

The puzzles that we solve in this project are the "Knights and Knaves" puzzles. In these puzzles, each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth, and a knave will always lie. The objective of the puzzle is to determine, for each character, whether they are a knight or a knave, based on the sentences they speak.

For example, consider a simple puzzle with a single character named A. A says "I am both a knight and a knave." Logically, we know that this sentence cannot be true because a character can only be one or the other. Therefore, we can conclude that A is a knave.

This project will take in a set of sentences spoken by each character and use propositional logic to represent the puzzle. An AI running a model-checking algorithm will then be able to solve the puzzle and determine the character's true identities.

Please refer to the code documentation for more information on how to use this project and the specific implementation details.
